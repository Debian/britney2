What is britney and britney2
============================

Britney2 is a program that can be used to `migrate` debian-based
packages from one suite to another.  It is the tool used by Debian and
Ubuntu to choose which packages are ready for wider testing.

Britney2 is the reimplementation and replacement of the original
britney program.  Through out this documentation, any mention of
britney generally refers to the britney2 implementation.  When there
is a need to reference the original britney implementation, this
documentation will use britney1.
