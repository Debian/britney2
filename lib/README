BUILDING
========

Install libapt-pkg-dev

testing/ $ make
testing/ $ mkdir old cur out
testing/ $ cd testing
testing/testing/ $ perl Makefile.PL
testing/testing/ $ make

Add old and new packages files into old and cur, respectively.

testing/ $ ./checklib i386 alpha

Will generate some test stuff in out/

TODO
====

Need some way of actually updating archives.
Need some way of judging differences between Packages files.
  (so I can see what hasn't been updated and work out why;
   so I can check that Packages.gz matches dpkg-scanpackages output)
Need some way of automatically explaining why packages aren't upgraded.
  (shouldn't be hard?)

BUGS
====

out/ directory must exist for checklib, or segfault
