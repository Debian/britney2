        This method attempts to create a table of packages that are
        equivalent (in terms of installability).  If two packages (A
        and B) are equivalent then testing the installability of A is
        the same as testing the installability of B.  This equivalency
        also applies to co-installability.

        The example cases:
        * aspell-*
        * ispell-*

        Cases that do *not* apply:
        * MTA's

        The theory:

        The packages A and B are equivalent iff:

          reverse_depends(A) == reverse_depends(B) AND
                conflicts(A) == conflicts(B)       AND
                  depends(A) == depends(B)

        Where "reverse_depends(X)" is the set of reverse dependencies
        of X, "conflicts(X)" is the set of negative dependencies of X
        (Breaks and Conflicts plus the reverse ones of those combined)
        and "depends(X)" is the set of strong dependencies of X
        (Depends and Pre-Depends combined).

        To be honest, we are actually equally interested another
        property as well, namely substitutability.  The package A can
        always used instead of B, iff:

          reverse_depends(A) >= reverse_depends(B) AND
                conflicts(A) <= conflicts(B)       AND
                  depends(A) == depends(B)

        (With the same definitions as above).  Note that equivalency
        is just a special-case of substitutability, where A and B can
        substitute each other (i.e. a two-way substituation).

        Finally, note that the "depends(A) == depends(B)" for
        substitutability is actually not a strict requirement.  There
        are cases where those sets are different without affecting the
        property.
